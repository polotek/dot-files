## Config files

These are all of my standard config files for unix environments (including OS X)

## Installation

* Copy all of the .dotfiles to `~/` (home dir)
* Copy bin files to `~/bin` (create if necessary)

The `completion` folder contains git completion and prompt enhancements. You shouldn't need these. They're already referenced in `.bashrc`. But this assumes an install of git that comes with these files. If you don't have them on OS X, you can usually get them with `brew install git`.
